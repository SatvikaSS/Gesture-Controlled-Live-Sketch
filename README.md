🎨 Gesture-Controlled Live Sketch
A beginner-friendly mini project using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

📌 Overview
This is my first mini project after starting to explore Image and Video Analytics.
It’s a real-time sketch application that responds to your hand gestures using a webcam feed.

✅ Show 5 fingers → Captures a sketch-style image
✌️ Show 2 fingers → Instantly exits the application
🎥 The webcam feed is processed into a pencil sketch live using OpenCV

✋ Features
-Live hand tracking with MediaPipe
-Real-time pencil sketch effect
-Gesture-based interaction (no buttons or keyboard needed)
-Saves sketch images with auto-generated filenames
-Visual indicators for finger count and gesture distance

🛠️ Tech Stack
-Python
-OpenCV
-MediaPipe
-NumPy
